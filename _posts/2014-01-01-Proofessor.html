<h2 class="clear-max" >How it Works:</h2>
<p class="clear-max">Select what spirits, liquors, or mixers you have available and would like to use. Then, the available recipe list filters down to fit your selected parameters. You'll have a refined list to select a recipe from and learn how to make it. If you're indecisive like me, simply shake your mobile device, and Proofessor will flip to a random recipe for you. Check out the bottom of this page to try it yourself!</p>

<h2 class="center">Building with Craft</h2>
	<p class="center">Craft is a beautiful, new custom content management system, created by Expression Engine developers <span>Pixel and Tonic</span>. Version 1.0 was released just a few weeks before Proofessor was conceptualized. Craft lets you create completely customized fields, pages, and forms for clients to have a visual back-end to update their website through, while using <span>Twig</span> as a templating engine to access this data. I wrote about the CMS on my blog <a href="http://blog.unakravets.com/post/53928357108/starting-to-craft">here</a> and about how to set it up from scratch on a Mac <a href="http://blog.unakravets.com/post/58150139083/the-absolute-beginners-guide-to-setting-up-craft-on-mac">here</a>.
	<br><br>
	Using Craft enabled the leanest possible approach to building this very information-driven project. After the system was set up, the project manager (Erica) and marketing intern (Jatin) spent time inputting recipes, icons, and fun facts, while the designer (Eli) and I continued to work on the animations and design.</p><br><br><br><br>

<h2>It's the Little Things</h2>
<p>I am definitely a strong believer that the nuances of a project are what make it. I made sure to include touches (in the form of CSS animations, in this case) to just add that little bit of sparkle. The logo mustache wiggles a little on hover, and the bottles flip and gray out when selected (they all flip back when "reset"). 

<br><br>
But not all of the animations planned actually made it into the production code. Originally I worked on a function to make the recipe count tally up and down upon changes, and the bottles to drain when selected, however I learned to let go of these fun quirks when they became too "expensive" for the browser to handle. I was taught to be a <span>defender of simplicity</span> and understand when to say no.</p>

<blockquote class="center push js-invert">As a front end developers, we often want to say "yes" to everything, but knowing when a task is too expensive <span>(when to say 'no')</span> is an important skill to have.</blockquote>

	<h2>The Proofessor Playground</h2>
	<p class="clear-max">
		I learned SO much about Javascript code from this project, and really had a chance to "play around" with different interactive functions. From playing with shaking (left) to reading the recipe count, it was important to be stay organized. The code was re-factored over and over, but turned out to be something I was very proud of: clean, object-oriented, and name spaced. I organized it mostly based on this model:
	</p>
<br>
<br>

<pre><code>window.PROOF || (PROOF = {}); //define a namespace (only ONCE) -- I used PROOF for Proofessor
(function($, window, document, undefined) {
  var _common = PROOF.common = { //this is your js object
    init: function() {
    this.setVars();
    this.bindEvents();
  },
  setVars: function() {
    // set all variables here
    this.helloString = "hello" ; // also _common.helloString
  },
  bindEvents: function() {
    // set event listeners for your functions here
  },
  // the rest of your functions go here
  _common.init(); // don't forget to init!
})(jQuery, window, document);
</code></pre>
