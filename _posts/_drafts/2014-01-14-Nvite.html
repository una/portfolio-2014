<h2>What is nvite?</h2>
<br>
<p>I joined the company in January 2014, when it was in its very early stages. My first tasks were preparing graphics for investor slides to try and get some funding, and the only employee were the four co-founders and me. I worked with some pretty amazing people and learned a lot from them. </p>
