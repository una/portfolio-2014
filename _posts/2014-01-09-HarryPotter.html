<h2 class="center">The Concept</h2>
<p class="center">
	The Harry Potter series is very special to many millennials who grew up with the books. Each novel is more complex than the last, and riddled with fantastically deep character development and lessons. The book set becomes a nostalgic relic to those who find so much significance in it. <br><br>
	These reinterpreted jacket designs are intended to serve as family heirlooms or keepsakes, with a more mature and elegant design, opposed to the now mass-produced original covers. (If you've read the books, you'll know just how important family heirlooms can turn out to be.) They take a design that was originally illustrative, intended to appeal to children, and replace it with something timeless, like the story itself.<br></p>

	<h2 class="center">A Unified Set</h2>
	<p class="center">Symbolism is a very important theme throughout the Harry Potter books. As the books progress, and its fantasy world falls further and further into ruin, so do the covers. Through clean geometric lines (which break apart as the series progresses) and icons, each cover in this series stands alone, but together tells the story of Harry Potter. </p>

	<h2>Typography</h2>
	<p>
		I wanted to use a really flowing and smooth typeface to create a contrast with the sharp geometric fragments of the cover. I heavily altered a rounded serif typeface based on hand sketches to serve as the basis of the title copy. Descriptive text on the back of the book was set in Mrs. Eaves.

<h2 class="clear-max">Geometric Design</h2>
<p class="clear-max">
	Each of the spines represent aspects of each Harry Potter title in the geometric look. In order of the series, the first shows the Sorcerer's Stone, the second is a basilisk (snake creature), third is a dog (Sirius Black's animagus), and the fourth is the Goblet of Fire.<br><br>
	One of the biggest challenges I faced with the design was sizing the covers and spines, because they were designed before I had all of the books in my possession. (Don't worry, I now proudly own the full series). Lesson learned: buy the book covers you're redesigning <span> before </span> designing them.
